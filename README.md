## How to play
Having fun is the most important thing, but if you also wanna win, then collect as many matching cards as you can. 
In your turn you pick two cards, in case they match, you collect them. 

>I added some exceptions, as a timer and bonus cards
>The bonus cards might change the game, as they allow you to peek some cards, delete them, auto-complete a matching set or steal time from your opponent.

### How do I win bonus cards?
They might appear once you pick some cards, or you might gain them if you are losing.
